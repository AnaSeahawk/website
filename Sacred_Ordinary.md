# The Sacred Ordinary 

We begin by remembering.

What the body receives  
is not only what is taken in through the mouth.

Perception is a form of intake.  
Digestion occurs at many levels.  
Clarity depends on what the senses receive.

Intention matters more than form.

Before we take in substance,  
we receive light.

A calm, unwavering source  
feeds perception  
before it feeds the stomach.

## The Threshold

Before we begin,  
you may choose  
to light a candle.

Notice how the flame  
is small, yet steady.

Luminous, without demand.

There is nothing you need to do with it.

Simply notice  
how the eyes receive  
before the mind engages.

This, too,  
is a kind of nourishment.

## Before the Seed Knows It Will Grow

*May this moment be enough.*  
*May what is already here be received.*  
*May the body soften into the time it is in,*  
*and may no part of us be asked to arrive before it is ready.*

Before hunger, there is a settling.  
A softening low in the belly, a quiet warmth, a sense of being held rather than pulled forward.

This chapter begins in that inward place where life gathers without effort — where earth is dark and receptive, and nothing is yet asked to rise. Here, nourishment is permission. Breath deepens on its own. The body learns again that it does not need to hurry toward growth. Safety is the first nutrient.

A seed does not begin with striving.  
It begins buried.

Held in soil.  
Wrapped in moisture.  
Surrounded by darkness that protects rather than demands.

Dormancy is not absence.  
It is life in right relationship with time.

A seed in dormancy is not paused —  
it is listening for season.

So it is with us.

We receive long before we consume.  
Intentions before meals.  
Atmospheres before ingredients.  
Conditions before calories.

The body begins to nourish itself through tone, timing, and trust — through the quiet question of; *is it safe enough to soften here?*

The womb knows this.  
Fertility exists even when nothing is forming.  
Waiting is not a failure of creation — it is one of its most intelligent states.

The gut knows this too.  
It does not want to be pushed awake.  
It wants to be invited.

This is nourishment before metabolism.  
Receiving before digestion.  
Trust before transformation.

The body does not keep time by clocks.  
It keeps time through resonance — through warmth, moisture, and coherence.

Beginnings are rarely dramatic.  
They arrive as quiet agreements between safety and season.

This chapter is about learning to recognize those agreements — the moments before action, the soil beneath intention, the darkness that holds life without asking it to prove itself.

Nothing here needs improvement.  
Nothing needs to be rushed.

Growth begins in safety, not demand.

Until the season turns, waiting is not delay.  
It is wisdom.

___

When the ground has softened enough, something begins to stir.

Not yet visible.  
Not yet named.  
But sensed.

The body does not rush to meet it.  
It allows itself to be met.

And from that quiet readiness, the first movement will come.
