# Sacred Ordinary 

***The Seed of Matter.***

This is the pure gift of Earth: matter before effort, nourishment before claim.

The body does not ask what will I do with this.
It asks only: ***Can you receive it.***

Right placement.
A seed set in soil that can hold it.
A body ready to be lived in, not driven.

There is no rush here.
Only the quiet intelligence of beginnings that know how to grow
without being told.

## The Threshold

Before we begin,  
you may choose  
to light a candle.

Notice how the flame  
is small, yet steady.

Luminous, without demand.

There is nothing you are asked to do with it.

Simply notice  
how the eyes receive  
before thought arrives.

This, too,  
is nourishment.

___

## Sacred Steadiness

*May this moment be enough.*  
*May what is already here be received.*  
*May the body soften into the era it is in,*  
*and may no part of us be asked to arrive before it is ready.*

***Before the Seed Knows It Will Grow***

Beginnings are rarely dramatic.  
They arrive as quiet agreements between safety and season.

The ***“womb-water”*** memory. The idea that a place, a moment, a body of water holds the original pulse of who we are.

We begin in that inward place where life gathers without effort — where earth is dark, moist and receptive, nothing is yet asked to rise. Here, nourishment is permission. Breath deepens on its own. The body learns again that it does not need to hurry toward growth. ***Safety is the first nourishment.***

A seed does not begin with striving.  
It begins buried.

Held in soil.  
Wrapped in moisture.  
Surrounded by darkness that protects rather than demands.

Dormancy is not absence.  
It is life in right relationship with time. A seed in dormancy is not paused —  
it is listening for season.

So it is with us.

We receive long before we consume.  
Intentions before meals.  
Atmospheres before ingredients.  
Circumstances before nourishment.

The body begins to nourish itself through tone, timing, and trust — through the quiet question it asks: *is it safe enough to soften here?*

The womb knows this.  
Fertility exists even when nothing is forming. Waiting is not a failure of creation — it is one of its most intelligent states.

The gut knows this too.  
***It does not want to be pushed awake.***  
***It wants to be invited.***

This is nourishment before the body begins its work.  
Receiving before digestion.  
Trust before the turning.

The body keeps time through resonance — through warmth, moisture, and felt order.

This space invites recognition of those intuitive agreements — the moments before action, the soil beneath intention, the darkness that holds life without asking it to prove itself.

Nothing here is lacking.  
Nothing needs to be rushed.

Growth begins in safety, not demand.

Until the season turns, waiting is not delay.  
It is wisdom.

___

Origin as ritual. Identity as a tide we revisit, not a fixed point.

Before hunger, there is a settling.  
A softening low in the belly, a quiet warmth, a sense of being held rather than pulled forward.

Only when the ground has warmed and softened enough does something begin to stir.

Not yet visible.  
Not yet named.  
But sensed.

The body does not rush to meet it.  
It allows itself to be met.

And from that quiet readiness, the first movement will come.

And when that first movement comes,  
it does not announce itself as need.

It arrives as sensation.  
A subtle hollowing.  
A warmth that gathers and asks for direction.

This is not urgency.  
It is communication.

Not a message shouted,  
but one spoken in the body’s native language.

What follows safety is not consumption,  
but curiosity.

Not *What is missing?*  
But *What is being communicated now?*

This is where hunger begins to speak.

___

## The Intelligence of Nourishment

### Given in Rhythm

**May this be received  
at life’s own pace.**

This is the sprouting stage —  
not where effort begins,  
but where **receptivity is awakened**.

Where reaching becomes intuitive.  
Where appetite learns its own shape.

True hunger clarifies.  
It sharpens the senses and brings the cycles of life into focus.

Borrowed hunger rushes.  
It confuses and asks for filling rather than meeting.

When hunger is allowed to speak in its own language, the inner waters remain clear.  
The fire warms without burning.  
The nerves soften instead of tightening.

Hunger, rightly heard, is not a demand.  
It is a signal of readiness.

A form of intelligence  
guiding us toward relationship,  
not accumulation.

## _Receiving Is Growing_

When nourishment is received in rhythm,  
the body does not rush to take more.  

***Growth asks not for excess,  
but for what can be received, circulated, and released in time.***

In this early stage, nourishment arrives like plasma or water to the roots —  
meeting the body where it is tender,  
before strength is asked of it.

Too much, too fast clouds perception.  
The signal of hunger dulls.  
The body tightens around what it cannot yet carry.

Given in rhythm, however,  
the body strengthens quietly.  
Not by effort,  
but by trust.

Growth shows itself subtly —  
as warmth in the chest,  
fullness in the blood,  
a gentle expansion that does not push forward.

Nourishment that supports this stage moves through rather than pooling. It steadies without overwhelming.

The body responds not with urgency, but with coherence.

Receiving here is an act of attunement.  
Like tending a young plant,  
care is offered at the roots,  
not poured from above.

Timing matters as much as substance.

When nourishment arrives in rhythm,  
trust develops —  
not as an idea,  
but as a lived sensation of enough.

This is how early growth is protected.  
Not through control,  
but through pacing.  
Not through fullness,  
but through steadiness.

True hunger feels like a communication arising from coherence, not a lack demanding correction.

What allows true growth is relationship, received in rhythm.

### **When Life Is Nourishing Us**

_Mothers, gardens, and learning to receive_

We are all being nourished.  
Even when it does not feel that way.

***The body is a cathedral of tides.***

We are receiving life while being tended by life at the same time.

The body is a garden.  
So is the child.  
So is the one who tends.

There is a quiet pressure placed on mothers —  
the expectation to produce,  
to measure,  
to prove nourishment through output.

Milk counted.  
Time tracked.  
Bodies watched for signs of success.

As if nourishment were mechanical,  
instead of relational.

But life does not arrive under scrutiny.  
Milk does not flow when the body is braced.  
Nourishment does not settle when safety is absent.

What is often named as lack  
is simply a body that has not been given space to receive.

We cannot make up for lost time  
by offering more.  
We cannot flood the roots  
and call it care.

Life nourishes through warmth.  
Through steadiness.  
Through being met without demand.

Nourishment is not something we force.  
It is something we allow.

When space is left,  
life responds.

Not always immediately.  
Not on command.  
But faithfully.

This, too,  
is the intelligence of nourishment.

## The Grace of Enough

Enough is a sensation.  
Not a decision.

It arrives when the body has received what it needs  
in the absence of urgency.

Shoulders and jaw soften.  
Breath finds its own rhythm.

Enough is known by ease.

This space restores trust in the body’s signal of completion through grace —  
the moment when warmth spreads  
and the senses say: *this is sufficient*.  
Not because nothing more exists,  
but because what is here has been fully received.

Grace appears before appetite.  
A quiet permission preceding desire.  
A softening that allows reception without grasping.

Fire settles.  
Earth holds without weight.

Enough is not restraint imposed from outside.  
It is the quiet satisfaction that leaves energy available for living.

What distorts hunger once it has learned to speak  
is not appetite,  
but interruption.

Overstimulation is not hunger.  
It is the body reaching for contact  
where reception has been interrupted.

Completion has its own intelligence.  
Sensation moves in arcs.  
Pleasure ripens.  
Satisfaction arrives, then rests.

The body remembers this.

Eating that finishes itself.  
Warmth that completes its spread.  
Touch that resolves into presence.  
Stimulation that becomes assimilation.

Nothing is known by its name.  
It is known by how it moves through the body —  
whether it warms or agitates,  
whether it settles or scatters,  
whether it leaves the body more present  
or more whole.

Enough is not moral.  
It is somatic.  
It is relational.

In the language of Art,  
enough is harmony arising  
when elements are allowed to meet.

The Art of Refinement

Seasoning completes the dish.  
The hand lifts from the canvas.  
Heat lowers itself.  
The work breathes.

Nothing is added.  
Nothing is withheld.

Form recognizes its own arrival.

Art knows when to stop.

This is not loss.  
It is dignity.

Enough is the point where life continues  
without collapse —  
warmth circulating,  
attention free,  
energy still available.

The body hears everything the mind says.

And it also hears silence.  
Timing.  
Permission that does not need to be named.

When trust is present,  
completion is natural.

Fullness feels clean.  
Satisfaction leaves space.  
Energy remains responsive.

Enough does not announce itself.  
It settles.

It feels like standing up from the table with clarity.  
Like warmth remaining in the limbs.  
Like knowing there is enough for now  
and enough for what comes next.

This is not abstinence.  
It is continuity restored.

There is a difference between overflow and excess.

Overflow moves outward.  
It nourishes the field —  
conversation, creativity, rest.

Excess thickens the moment  
and makes continuation feel heavy.

Enough circulates.

When the body knows enough,  
pleasure remains available.  
Desire moves freely.  
Energy does not need guarding.

This is maturation.

Confidence in rhythm.  
Ease in timing.  
Freedom in response.

Enough is warmth that stays.  
Enough is the body resting inside its own timing.

Completion is trusted.  
Sensation is allowed to finish.  
The body remembers how to stop  
without fear.

This space does not ask anyone to eat less.  
It invites the body to receive fully —  
until the body itself says: *this is sufficient.*

And from that sufficiency,  
life continues.

—

Cupid and my Campaspe play’d  
At cards for kisses—Cupid paid:  
He stakes his quiver, bow, and arrows,  
His mother’s doves, and team of sparrows;  
Loses them too; then down he throws  
The coral of his lip, the rose  
Growing on ’s cheek (but none knows how);  
With these, the crystal of his brow,  
And then the dimple of his chin:  
All these did my Campaspe win.  
At last he set her both his eyes—  
She won, and Cupid blind did rise.  
O Love! has she done this to thee?

Desire does not lose through error,  
but through continuation.

It keeps wagering  
what it already needs to see.

First the instruments of aim.  
Then the ornaments of charm.  
Then the subtle recognitions —  
the rose, the dimple, the brow.

Nothing is taken.  
Everything is offered.

And still, it is not enough.

Only when sight itself is placed on the table  
does the game end.

Love rises blind not as punishment,  
but as consequence.  
When completion is not recognized,  
perception gives way to surrender.

Enough is never named.  
It is felt precisely by its absence.

Surrender does not arrive as virtue or sacrifice.  
It arrives when there is nothing left  
to prove, to charm, or to secure.

What remains is a love  
that can no longer aim,  
calculate,  
or negotiate.

It can only be present.

Dignity returns the moment we stop.  
The game ends.  
The body knows it has been fully received.

Desire releases its sight  
and becomes, at last,  
available to what is already here.

The poem stops  
where the body must stop —  
at the moment of recognition.
