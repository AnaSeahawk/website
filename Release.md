### **What No Longer Needs Carrying**

## **The One Who Learned to Release**

In the time before fire forgot how to sleep,  
the women buried a flame in the earth.  
Not to put it out,  
but to give it a body that could hold heat without spectacle.

Into the pit they placed small offerings —  
bits of food, tokens of memory, agreements made without words.  
They covered it and walked away.

Days passed.  
Weeks, perhaps.  
No one kept watch.

When they returned, the earth was opened.  
Wind moved across the hollow,  
and the fire rose again,  
not because it was summoned,  
but because it remembered how to breathe.

No one ate from the food left nearby.  
This was not a moment for hunger.  
This was a moment for seeing.

A garland of mint was lifted  
and placed around the neck of a man.  
Its scent cooled his throat and chest.  
He did not speak.  
He did not lead.  
He stood, tempered,  
heat held in leaf and air.

After this, there was a pause.

I was sitting on a bench  
with an older man beside me.

A younger woman approached.  
She spoke to him as though she knew him —  
not with familiarity,  
but with precision.

She named things about his life  
that she could not have known.  
He knew this.  
He knew they were strangers.

She spoke of his habits,  
of his pleasures,  
of how much he liked champagne  
and how he drank too much of it.

There were other things,  
but they did not linger.

What lingered was his recognition.

He was so taken aback  
that he stood and walked away with her,  
drawn not by trust,  
but by the undeniable accuracy  
of being seen.

They spoke as they went.

Then I walked to the water.

There, a mother moved across the surface  
in a small boat turned by her feet.  
Her motion was slow, continuous,  
as if she trusted the distance would close itself.

Strapped beside the boat  
floated a cradle meant for an infant.  
From afar, it looked full.  
From habit, it was assumed full.

The child was already in the water.

The child swam with ease,  
tethered to a soft animal  
still resting in its floating cradle —  
a comfort once needed,  
now carried by something  
the child no longer inhabited.

The mother brought the boat to rest.  
She did not call the child back.  
She did not reach for the cradle.

Only then  
did the child pull the soft figure free,  
not in haste,  
not in fear,  
but because the water had already taught  
what could move on its own.

The cradle floated, emptied of purpose.  
The child swam on.

I watched.  
The fire breathed.  
The water held.

And nothing was asked to return  
to the shape it had outgrown.

*May fire rest, may water hold, and may no life be mistaken for its memory.*
