## *The yoni as a field of remembrance*

The yoni has never been merely anatomical.  

In the ancient imagination, she was a **field** — responsive, rhythmic, intelligent — a place where time, temperature, season, and relationship converge before anything takes form. Creation was understood as conditional, not commanded. Nothing arrived without readiness.

This is the ground from which both Tantra and the **Kāma Sūtra** speak.  
Not as manuals of technique, but as philosophies of **attunement**.

Tantra did not approach the yoni as something to fix or purify.  
She was approached as **śakti-kṣetra** — the living field of power.  
Reverence came first, listening before touch.  
The instruction was not *do*, but *enter relationship*.  
Where there is force, śakti withdraws.  
Where there is patience, she reveals herself.

The Kāma Sūtra, often flattened into caricature, carries this same thread.  
It is not a book about performance, but about **harmony**.  
Pleasure is named as a *diagnostic signal* — ease indicates alignment; discomfort signals mis-timing.  
There is no obsession with internal cleansing, no fixation on fluids as impure.  
What mattered was comfort, rhythm, readiness, and the dignity of stopping when the body said no.

These texts arose in worlds radically different from ours.  
They assumed a cosmology where sexuality was not extracted from life, monetized, or fragmented.  
They assumed women who knew their cycles, communities that understood fertility as sacred timing, and intimacy that carried consequence — not only pregnancy, but relationship, responsibility, and transformation.

We do not live in that world.

We live in a time where women’s bodies have been managed, optimized, numbed, sexualized, and made endlessly available.  
Where fertility (especially in youth) is mostly treated as an inconvenience to be suppressed rather than a rhythm to be understood.  
Where young girls are prescribed hormonal control, for painful bleeding and other bodily changes, without being taught to read what their bodies are saying.  
Where the only “risk” named in sexuality is pregnancy — not dissociation, not loss of sensation, not the erosion of self-trust.

Something essential has been lost.

And so it is not surprising that women today feel a pull — sometimes clumsy, sometimes urgent — to return to their bodies.  
To feel again.  
To reclaim sensation.  
To dissolve shame.  
To remember what was never taught.

This pull is not about hygiene.  
It is about **somatic re-inhabitation**.

When ancient practices are lifted out of context and repeated without lineage or containment, they can distort.  
Technique replaces relationship.  
Intervention replaces listening.  
The field is managed instead of met.  

But the longing beneath these experiments is valid.  
It is the longing to come home.

I felt this shift viscerally after attending a Tantra workshop, as a friend in a position of support.  
I witnessed trauma move through his body and release — not through analysis, but through presence, safety, and attuned non-sexual touch.  
Something in me reorganized.  
My reverence for my own body deepened.  
Sex stopped being an act and became a dialogue.  

I could feel, in my bones, how differently I might have known myself — and men — had I been raised with this literacy.

This is where the ancient wisdom meets the present moment.

Tantra and the Kāma Sūtra do not ask us to recreate the past.  
They ask us to restore **orientation**:  
from control to consent,  
from performance to perception,  
from hygiene to relationship.

The yoni is not a cavity to manage.  
She is a field that responds.

Her fluids are not messy, dirty or contagious.  
They are **language** — speaking in temperature, timing, scent, texture, rhythm.  
To erase them in the name of cleanliness is to erase information.  
To shame them is to interrupt perception.

What women are seeking now is not permission to do more to their bodies.  
It is permission to **listen again**.  
To understand the sacred geometry of cycles — waxing and waning, opening and closing, fertility and rest.
To know when they are receptive and when they are not.  
To let risk mean more than pregnancy — to let it mean presence.

The absence of this knowledge is the root of *dis-ease*.

Ancient texts held this knowledge quietly.  
They assumed it would be transmitted through culture, touch, and time.  
We must translate it now — not literally, but ethically — into a world that has forgotten how to feel.

The reclamation of the yoni is not radical because it adds something new.  
It is radical because it restores **relationship**.

And relationship, once remembered, changes everything.
