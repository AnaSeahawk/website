# The Field of Eros  
## Women Restoring the Conditions of Wholeness

*A research-based book architecture and orientation manual*

---

## Research Orientation

This book is a field-based inquiry into sexuality as a somatic, imaginal, and civilizational intelligence.

It is:
- not ideological  
- not therapeutic  
- not instructional  
- not corrective  

It assumes the reader is already perceptive, already questioning, already aware that something essential has been lost.

**Primary premise:**  
Sexuality itself is not broken.  
The conditions that once oriented it have collapsed.

This book does not seek to repair sexuality, but to restore the **field** through which eros can once again settle, complete, and belong to life.

---

## Core Thesis (Held Quietly Throughout)

Modern sexuality is saturated with stimulation and starved of containment.  
What has been lost is not freedom, but **completion**.

Women are not called here to reclaim sexuality, but to **reconstitute the receptive field** through which eros regains coherence.

This is leadership through reception, not assertion.
