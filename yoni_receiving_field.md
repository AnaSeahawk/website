# A Practice of Remembering  
## Listening the Body into Relationship

*No one is asked to agree with what follows,  
only to notice what the body receives  
as the words enter the field.*

Before we begin, a clarification.

The word **yoni** is not a euphemism, nor a synonym for “vagina.”  
In its original Sanskrit usage, *yoni* means **source**, **origin**, **womb**, **place of emergence**.  
It names the generative field through which life takes form.

The yoni includes the physical womb and vaginal passage,  
but it is not limited to anatomy.  
It also refers to the **energetic, perceptual, and relational space**  
through which creation, sensation, sexuality, and memory move.

In this work, *yoni* is used in that fuller sense —  
as a **living field**, not an object;  
a site of responsiveness, not something to be managed.

## Introduction: Entering the Practice 

***This work begins with a remembering.***

Not of ideas, but of the body —  
not as something to be managed, corrected, or optimized,  
but as an intelligence shaped by rhythm, timing, and relationship.

It is written for women returning authorship of their lives  
to the place where it has always lived.

Not through force.  
Not through repair.  
But through restored continuity.

What follows draws from ancient lineages  
while speaking directly to the conditions of the present.  
It offers no instruction to follow  
and makes no demands of the body.

It asks only for presence,  
and for the willingness to listen.

## The Yoni as a Field of Remembrance

The yoni has never been merely anatomical.

In the ancient imagination, she was understood as a **field** —  
responsive, rhythmic, and intelligent.  
A place where time, temperature, season, and relationship converge  
before anything takes form.

Creation was not commanded.  
It was conditional.  
Nothing arrived without readiness.

This is the ground from which both Tantra and the Kāma Sūtra speak —  
and it is essential to be precise about what those words mean.

### Listening to What Tantra Names

Tantra is not a sexual method.  
It is not a performance system.  
It is not a set of techniques designed to extract sensation  
or intensify experience.

Tantra names a **relational cosmology**.

Its concern is not what is done,  
but how reality is entered.  
Its central question is orientation:

*How does consciousness meet matter without domination?*

Within this framework, the yoni is not approached as something to fix, cleanse, stimulate, or optimize.  
She is approached as **śakti-kṣetra** — a living field of power.

Reverence comes first.  
Listening precedes touch.  
The instruction is not *do*, but *enter relationship*.

Where there is force, śakti withdraws.  
Where there is patience, she reveals herself.

When Tantra is reduced to sexual technique, it becomes self-contradictory —  
using control to seek surrender,  
manipulation to reach intimacy.

This is not Tantra.  
It is extraction wearing spiritual language.

### Kāma Sūtra: Relationship as Intelligence 

The Kāma Sūtra is not an erotic manual.  
It is not a catalogue of positions.  
It is not concerned with novelty, endurance, or performance.

It is a text on **harmony**.

Pleasure is treated not as a goal,  
but as a *diagnostic signal*.  
Ease indicates alignment.  
Discomfort signals mis-timing.

The text assumes that bodies are already intelligent.  
Its concern is whether relationship honors that intelligence.

There is no obsession with purification.  
No fixation on fluids as impure or dangerous.  
No imperative to push past discomfort.

What matters is rhythm, readiness, mutual attunement —  
and the dignity of stopping when the body says no.

Flattened into modern caricature, the Kāma Sūtra loses its ethical spine.  
Removed from its cosmology, it becomes another performance script —  
the very thing it was written to prevent.

---

### A World Oriented by Relationship 

These teachings arose in worlds radically different from ours.

They assumed women who knew their cycles.  
Communities that understood fertility as sacred timing, not inconvenience.  
Intimacy that carried consequence —  
not only pregnancy,  
but relationship, responsibility, and transformation.

They assumed a world where sexuality was not extracted from life,  
monetized, medicalized, or endlessly available.

We do not live in that world.

We live in a time where women’s bodies have been managed, optimized, numbed, sexualized, and surveilled.  
Where fertility — especially in youth — is treated as a problem to suppress  
rather than a rhythm to be read.  
Where girls are prescribed hormonal control for pain and bleeding  
without being taught how to listen to what their bodies are communicating.

The risks named in sexuality are now pregnancy and disease —  
not dissociation,  
not loss of sensation,  
not the erosion of self-trust.

Something essential has been lost.

### The Pull to Remember — and Its Confusion

It is not surprising that women feel a pull —  
sometimes clumsy, sometimes urgent —  
to return to their bodies.

To feel again.  
To reclaim sensation.  
To dissolve shame.  
To remember what was never taught.

This pull is not about hygiene.  
It is about **somatic re-inhabitation**.

But when ancient practices are lifted out of context  
and repeated without lineage, containment, or ethical grounding,  
distortion occurs.

Technique replaces relationship.  
Intervention replaces listening.  
The field is managed instead of met.

Still, the longing beneath these experiments is real.  
It is the longing to come home.

### When the Body Recognizes 

I felt this shift viscerally after attending a Tantra workshop —  
not as a participant seeking experience,  
but as a friend in a position of support.

I witnessed trauma move through a body and release —  
not through analysis,  
but through presence, safety,  
and attuned, non-sexual touch.

Something in me reorganized.

My reverence for my own body deepened.  
Sex ceased to be an act  
and became a dialogue.

I could feel, in my bones,  
how differently I might have known myself — and men —  
had this literacy been part of my upbringing.

### Cross-Cultural Fields of Remembering 

Across Toltec lineages, the womb is spoken of as a *dream box* —  
a vessel where dreams, intentions, and unspoken futures are held.  
Healing is not correction,  
but the restoration of sovereign dreaming.

Across Siberian and Eurasian shamanic traditions,  
the womb appears again as a container of worlds —  
mirrored in cauldrons, ovens, hollow trees, and caves.

These are not symbols of danger,  
but of gestation.  
What enters is reshaped  
before it returns.

Across cultures, the message is consistent:

The womb is not only where life begins —  
it is where reality is dreamed into form.

### What Listening Restores

Tantra and the Kāma Sūtra do not ask us to recreate the past.  
They ask us to restore **orientation**.

From control to consent.  
From performance to perception.  
From hygiene to relationship.

The yoni is not a cavity to manage.  
She is a field that responds.

Her fluids are not dirty, messy, or contaminating.  
They are **language** —  
speaking in temperature, timing, scent, texture, and rhythm.

To erase them in the name of cleanliness  
is to erase information.  
To shame them  
is to interrupt perception.

What women are seeking now  
is not permission to do more to their bodies.

It is permission to **listen again**.

To understand the sacred geometry of cycles —  
opening and closing,  
fertility and rest.  
To know when receptivity is present  
and when it is not.  
To let risk mean more than pregnancy —  
to let it mean presence.

The absence of this knowledge  
is the root of *dis-ease*.

Ancient texts held this knowledge quietly.  
They assumed it would be transmitted  
through culture, touch, and time.

We must translate it now —  
not literally,  
but ethically and somatically —  
into a world that has forgotten how to feel.

The reclamation of the yoni is not radical  
because it adds something new.

It is radical  
because it restores **relationship**.

And relationship, once remembered,  
changes everything.

### Footnote on Language & Lineage

**Tantra**, as referenced in this work, does not name a sexual modality  
or a collection of techniques.  
It refers to a family of ancient Indian philosophical lineages  
concerned with **relationship, orientation, and the ethical meeting of consciousness and matter**.

The **Kāma Sūtra** is a classical text on *kāma* —  
pleasure understood as relational intelligence —  
concerned with harmony, readiness, and dignity,  
not performance or excess.

Throughout this work, these traditions are referenced  
**philosophically and somatically**, not instructionally.  
They are treated as **orientation texts**, not methods to be replicated.

### On How This Work Is Meant To Be Received 

This work does not offer sexual instruction, cleansing protocols, or embodied techniques.

It is not an invitation to intervene upon the body,  
manage sensation,  
or reenact ancient practices  
outside their cultural, relational, or ethical contexts.

References to Tantra, the Kāma Sūtra,  
and cross-cultural womb traditions  
are offered in service of **listening**, not doing;  
**relationship**, not performance;  
**perception**, not prescription.

If methods or guarantees of transformation are sought,  
this is not that work.

If a slower return to bodily trust feels possible,  
this work may be received.

*May pain be understood  
as a pause in flow,  
not a flaw in the body.*

## A Vow of Remembering

Hands rest at the lower belly.  
Breath is known.

Warmth gathers.  
Listening is present.

The womb remembers rhythm.  
The body remembers timing.

Authorship returns  
without effort.

What is already here  
speaks.
