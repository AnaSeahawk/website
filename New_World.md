# **Plasma — the foundation of a new world.**  
**The living current that remembers who we truly are.**

As the sages said:

> **“Within the heart flows a river,  
> whose waters shine like light.  
> Through it, all beings are bound together.”**  
> — *Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad* **1.5.23**

In the subtle waters is stored the seed of every world,  
the ojas that carries our consciousness,  
the rasa that flows back to its single source.

The ancients knew:  
what glows within us is older than breath,  
and it is through this luminous current  
that we remember ourselves again.
