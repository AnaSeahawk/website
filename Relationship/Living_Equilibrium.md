## Orienting the Body — Feeling the Doṣas

This field guide does not begin with categories.  
It begins with sensation.

**Āyurveda** is a Sanskrit compound:  
- **āyus** — life, vitality, duration, the lived span  
- **veda** — knowledge, wisdom, the act of knowing  

Āyurveda means **“the knowledge of life”**—not life as an abstract idea, but life as it is experienced through the body over time.

It is not a personality system, nor a diagnostic tool meant to sort people.  
It is a way of **listening to how life moves through the body**.

Before we name anything, we feel.

### Let the Body Arrive First

Pause.

Notice:  
- temperature  
- weight or lightness  
- speed of breath  
- the texture of attention  

Do not analyze.  
Let the body speak before the mind answers.

What is being sensed is not *who the body is*.  
It is **how the body is moving right now**.

### The Three Movements of Life

In Āyurveda, there are **three doṣas**—fundamental functional principles that describe how physiology and psychology organize and move.  
Every body expresses all three, in unique proportions.

The word *doṣa* means “that which can shift or go out of balance.”

They are not identities.  
They are **patterns of movement**.

#### Vāta — movement

**Functions:** motion, circulation, nerve impulses, breath, elimination  

**Qualities:** light, dry, cold, subtle, mobile  

**When balanced:** creativity, clarity, adaptability  

**When disturbed:** anxiety, dryness, irregular digestion, restlessness  

*Felt sense:*  
**“I move before I settle.”**

#### Pitta — transformation

**Elements:** Fire + Water  

**Functions:** digestion, metabolism, vision, discernment  

**Qualities:** hot, sharp, oily, penetrating  

**When balanced:** intelligence, courage, strong digestion  

**When disturbed:** inflammation, irritation, excess heat, acidity  

*Felt sense:*  
**“I burn toward what matters.”**

#### Kapha — structure

**Elements:** Earth + Water  

**Functions:** stability, lubrication, immunity, growth  

**Qualities:** heavy, cool, moist, steady, dense  

**When balanced:** strength, calm, endurance, compassion  

**When disturbed:** congestion, lethargy, heaviness, stagnation  

*Felt sense:*

### A Question the Body Answers

When the body feels out of balance,  
what restores it most reliably?

Warmth and rest → Vāta  

Cooling and space → Pitta  

Movement and stimulation → Kapha  

The body answers this more accurately than any questionnaire.

### A Necessary Distinction

- **Prakṛti:** how the body tends to organize over time  
- **Vikṛti:** how the body is organizing right now  

One may recognize a primary pattern and still be living temporarily in another.  
This is not a contradiction. It is responsiveness.

---

### A Brief Embodied Check

Try each for one minute:

- Sit completely still  
- Lie down and do nothing  
- Stand and move briskly  

Notice which feels hardest to sustain.

Resistance often reveals dominance.

### Closing Orientation — Living in Equilibrium

This kind of body knowledge is not meant for fixing or controlling.  
It is meant for **maintaining equilibrium across the changing seasons of life**.

As age, environment, relationships, work, and inner rhythms shift, the doṣas shift with them.  
What once restored may later overwhelm.  
What once felt heavy may later be stabilizing.

By learning to feel these changes early—through temperature, appetite, energy, and mood—the body is met **before imbalance hardens into distress**.

Harmony is maintained not by holding one state,  
but by **responding in time**.

Āyurveda offers a language for this ongoing listening—  
a way to adjust gently, season by season, phase by phase,  
so the body can remain in relationship with life as it unfolds.

This guide does not aim to correct the body.  
It aims to **restore trust in its intelligence**.

Begin by listening.
