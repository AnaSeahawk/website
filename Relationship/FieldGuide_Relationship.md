# A Field Guide to Relationship

## *Plants, Bodies, and the Intelligence of Use*

***Healing is not about adding more.***
***It is about knowing how and when to receive.***

### Editor’s Note

This field guide is not organized around systems, substances, or solutions, but around **relationship**. Each plant is approached as a living presence that meets the body at a particular moment, under particular conditions, and within particular lineages of knowing. Āyurveda, Western herbal traditions, and astrology are used here as *ways of seeing*, not as interchangeable authorities. No plant is elevated by name alone, and none is diminished by origin. What matters is how a substance moves through the body, how it is prepared, when it is taken, and whether it restores trust rather than urgency. The entries that follow are not instructions to follow, but invitations to listen — slowly, specifically, and without violence — to what the body is already capable of receiving.

### A Methodological Note on Āyurveda and Plant Use

In this work, Āyurveda is used as a **method of perception**, not a catalogue of approved substances.

I do not treat Āyurveda as a branding system in which a plant becomes valid by being named in a classical text, nor do I retrofit non-Indian herbs into Sanskrit lists to grant them authority. Such gestures flatten a living science into aesthetic endorsement.

Āyurveda, as I practice and apply it here, is a way of *reading*:  
of observing **rasa** (taste), **guṇa** (qualities), **vīrya** (thermal action), **vipāka** (post-digestive effect), and **karma** (movement through the body).  
Substances are known not by origin or label, but by **what the body receives** in relationship with them.

Plants that do not appear in the classical Saṃhitās are therefore not called “Āyurvedic.”  
They are approached **Āyurvedically**—through context, preparation, timing, constitution, and restraint.

This distinction matters.

It preserves the integrity of Āyurveda as a geographically rooted and historically coherent tradition, while allowing its principles to remain *alive*—capable of meeting new landscapes, new bodies, and new circumstances without distortion.

Where modern language tends toward extraction (“detox,” “protocol,” “active compounds”), Āyurveda insists on **relationship**.  
How something is taken matters as much as what is taken.  
Warmth, fat, rhythm, and respect are not embellishments; they are part of the medicine.

What follows, then, is not an attempt to modernize Āyurveda or universalize it.  
It is an attempt to **listen with it**—  
and to let that listening guide how substances are named, prepared, and received.
