**Living as art**

All true achievements are found inward.
What matters most is the path of heart.

## What I’m offering

Presence as art.
Time as devotion.

I host **small, private gatherings** for people engaged in deep, body-based practices that are not meant to be done alone.

These are not programs, workshops, teachings, or methods.
It is a space where **presence itself is the work,** and where **lived experience** can be spoken without performance or correction.

My role is not to instruct.
It is to **remain present,** so others can feel their own ground again.

## Mother Spirit - A Gathering Place

- A **monthly live call** (Zoom, with video from me; participation always optional)
- A **private online space** for ongoing reflection and conversation (Telegram/Facebook)
- No recordings
- No products
- No pressure to speak, share, or show yourself

People come from many different practices and phases of life.
What connects them is a willingness to **stay with what is happening,** rather than reaching for explanation or escape.

## Orientation

I live and work from a simple premise:
**presence as art, time as devotion.**

I am an **amarolī practitioner,** and my inquiry has unfolded outside formal institutions, credentials, and conventional structures. What guides me is not ideology, but whether something can be felt, integrated, and lived.

I’m not interested in language that pulls people out of their bodies, or in concepts that cannot be embodied. I care about what remains when ideas fall away.

The aim is not transcendence.
It is **grounding.**

## A note on time and commitment

This space is for those who understand that some forms of work require **time** — not intensity, not urgency, not constant activity.

Here, time is not something to optimize or consume.
It is something to **offer.**

Some people arrive briefly.
Others stay longer. Some come and go.

All are welcome, but the deeper work reveals itself through continuity.

## If this speaks to you

Details about upcoming gatherings are shared quietly, by inquiry or invitation.

Some of what I share is freely offered.
Some is held in containers.
Patronage helps the work remain unforced.

There is no application.
No promise of outcome.
Only an invitation to arrive.
