## Preface 

This text is offered as a field record rather than a manual.  
What follows names patterns of engagement that have appeared across time and practice.  
Nothing here is required. Nothing is promised.  
The reader is invited to notice what the body receives.

## Internal Practices

The practice of amarolī begins inwardly, through relationship with the body’s own cycles.  
These are orientations within the practice, not prescriptions.

1. **Morning Mid-Stream Intake**  
   The practice opens with receiving the first mid-stream portion of the morning flow, when the body has been at rest.

2. **Looping**  
   As the day unfolds, the practice may continue by returning to what has already passed through the body, establishing continuity.

3. **Saturation**  
   At certain stages, engagement may deepen through increased intake, allowing the practice to permeate more fully.

4. **Subtle Dosing**  
   The practice may also be approached lightly, through small amounts or dilution, favoring sensitivity over intensity.

5. **Use of the Aged Portion**  
   At times, what has been allowed to mature over days or longer may be included, introducing time as an active element.

6. **Periods of Fasting**  
   The practice may be undertaken for a defined period using only the returning flow and water, allowing attention to settle inwardly.

7. **Infusions**  
   Herbal preparations may accompany the practice, without altering its essential orientation.

8. **Internal–External Continuity**  
   The inward practice may be mirrored outwardly through application over the body, maintaining a single field of attention.

9. **Immersion**  
   Occasionally, immersion in water to which the aged portion has been added extends the practice into the surrounding environment.
