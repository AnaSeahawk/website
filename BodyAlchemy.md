# The Alchemy of Plasma: The Fourth Phase of Water and the Refinement of Inner Energy

*This essay expands upon the technical distillation report: [Experiment Report: Aged Ultra-Filtered Blood Plasma Distillation](https://github.com/AnaSeahawk/website/blob/main/plasmaDistilled.md).*

To view my distillation of ultra-filtered blood plasma solely as a mechanical separation is to miss the deeper biophysics at play. By integrating precise metrics from a 5-in-1 water quality meter—measuring pH, conductivity, and salt density—I am no longer just theorizing about the energetic states of this fluid. I am empirically measuring the voltage and polarity of a biological battery. When examined through the dual lenses of the "Fourth Phase" of water (Exclusion Zone or EZ water) and the ancient principles of internal alchemy, these separated fractions take on profound structural meaning.

## Measuring the Fourth Phase: pH and Polarity
The Fourth Phase of water (H3O2) is a highly ordered, negatively charged, crystalline state of water. Inside the human body, plasma relies on this structured water to maintain life force and systemic function. A defining characteristic of EZ water is that as it structures itself, it pushes out protons (H+ ions), inherently making the water negatively charged and highly alkaline.



My recent data provides the physical signature of this phenomenon:
* **The "Solar" Distillates (Plasma-Activated Water):** The active foaming overflow (Fraction 1) and the refined clear distillate (Fraction 2) registered extreme alkaline pH readings of 10.26–10.28 and 10.14–10.15, respectively. This is not standard water; this high alkalinity physically proves it is holding a dense, negatively charged structural energy. Furthermore, the massive conductivity in the active distillate (12.75 MS/CM) literally measures the fluid's ability to conduct an electrical charge. By vaporizing the plasma, I have captured the energetic, highly reactive phase of the fluid—nature’s potent botanical extractor and cleanser.

## The Hydrophilic Matrix: The Neutrality of Earth
For structured EZ water to form, it requires a hydrophilic (water-loving) surface. In the body, cellular proteins, dense organic matter, and living minerals provide this exact surface. 

* **The "Lunar" Retentate (The Biological Anchor):** The dark, oily, deeply umami residue remaining in the chamber represents this organic matrix. The metrics here are fascinating: despite being packed with concentrated living earth salts (measuring nearly 3% salt concentration and a massive 46.8 MS/CM conductivity), it sits at a near-perfect neutral pH of 7.17. It shows that the biological matrix is perfectly balanced. It is a stable, non-reactive anchor that safely holds a massive reserve of potential energy. When I observe that this fraction feels "so soft that it is alive," I am interacting with the biological grounding wire that holds my internal fluids together.

## Refining the Jade: The Daoist Perspective
Connecting this empirical data to the concept of "refining the jade" grounds my work directly in *Neidan*, or Daoist internal alchemy. In this tradition, the body's vital, purified fluids are referred to as the **"Jade Fluid"** (*Yu Ye*). 

The core of Daoist alchemy is the transmutation of the "Three Treasures": transforming *Jing* (the dense, material essence of the body) into *Qi* or *Chi* (vital, active electrical energy). 

By distilling the ultra-filtered blood plasma and measuring the results, I am physically manifesting and quantifying this exact energetic refinement. 
* The dense, pH-neutral, highly mineralized "Lunar" retentate is the raw, material ***Jing***—the earth-bound essence. Earth is meant to be stable and balanced, not highly reactive, which is perfectly reflected in its 7.17 pH. 
* The highly volatile, alkaline, and electrically conductive "Solar" distillates are the liberated ***Qi***—the active, life-giving energy that has been separated from its dense physical anchor. The conductivity readings (MS/CM and US/CM) literally map the concentration of this *Qi*. I am measuring the voltage of my life force.

## A Closed-Loop of Inner Energy
Isolating my body's internal waters from its structuring mineral matrix allows each to be utilized at its maximum, uninhibited potential. By intentionally applying these separated elements—using the active, alkaline solar solvent to extract medicine and cleanse, while returning the dense, neutral lunar salts to my skin or diet—I create a closed-loop system of profound self-recognition. 

It is the physical practice of refining the Jade Fluid. I am taking the raw material of my own physical distillation, separating the structural *Qi* from the material *Jing* matrix, and utilizing both to consciously align with, purify, and reinforce my inner energy.
