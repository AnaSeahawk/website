# The Alchemy of Plasma: The Fourth Phase of Water and the Refinement of Inner Energy

*This essay expands upon the technical distillation report: [Experiment Report: Aged Ultra-Filtered Blood Plasma Distillation](https://github.com/AnaSeahawk/website/blob/main/plasmaDistilled.md).*

To view my distillation of ultra-filtered blood plasma solely as a mechanical separation is to miss the deeper biophysics at play. When I examine this process through the lens of the "Fourth Phase" of water (Exclusion Zone or EZ water) and the ancient principles of internal alchemy, the separated fractions take on profound structural and energetic meaning. 

## The Physics of the Fractions: EZ Water and the Hydrophilic Matrix
The Fourth Phase of water (H3O2) is a highly ordered, negatively charged, crystalline state of water that acts much like a biological battery. Inside the human body, plasma relies on this structured water to maintain life force and systemic function. 

For this structured water to form, it requires a hydrophilic (water-loving) surface. In the body, cellular proteins, dense organic matter, and living minerals provide this exact surface. 

When I distill the plasma, I am physically deconstructing this biological battery:
* **The "Lunar" Retentate (The Hydrophilic Matrix):** The dark, oily, deeply umami residue—packed with concentrated living earth salts and reading well over 9999 PPM—is the dense, organic matrix. When I observe that this fraction feels "so soft that it is alive," I am interacting with the very material that anchors and structures the fluid inside me. It is the biological grounding wire. 
* **The "Solar" Distillate (Plasma-Activated Water):** The extreme volatility and energetic readings of the foaming overflow (Fraction 1) suggest a highly reactive, structured fluid. By vaporizing the plasma, I capture the energetic phase of the fluid. In laboratory settings, Plasma-Activated Water is celebrated for its high reactivity and profound cleaning power. My collected fraction mimics those exact qualities, naturally acting as a potent botanical extractor and wound cleaner. 

## Refining the Jade: The Daoist Perspective
Remembering the concept of "refining the jade" connects this work directly to *Neidan*, or Daoist internal alchemy. In this tradition, the body's vital, purified fluids are referred to as the **"Jade Fluid"** (*Yu Ye*) or the "Sweet Dew." 

The core of Daoist alchemy is the transmutation of the "Three Treasures": transforming *Jing* (the dense, material essence of the body) into *Qi* or *Chi* (vital, active energy), and ultimately into *Shen* (spirit). 

By distilling the ultra-filtered blood plasma, I am physically manifesting this exact energetic refinement. The dense, umami "Lunar" retentate is the raw, material *Jing*—the earth-bound essence and living salts. The highly volatile, purifying "Solar" distillate is the liberated *Qi*—the active, life-giving energy that has been separated from its dense physical anchor. 

## A Closed-Loop of Inner Energy
Isolating my body's internal waters from its structuring mineral matrix allows each to be utilized at its maximum, uninhibited potential. By intentionally applying these separated elements—using the active solar solvent to extract medicine and cleanse, while returning the dense, lunar salts to my skin or diet—I create a closed-loop system of profound self-recognition. 

It is the physical practice of refining the Jade Fluid. I am taking the raw material of my own physical distillation, separating the structural energy from the material matrix, and utilizing both to consciously align with, purify, and reinforce my own inner *Chi*.
