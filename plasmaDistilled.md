# Experiment Report & Journal Entry: Aged Ultra-Filtered Blood Plasma Distillation

**Date:** February 18–19, 2026  
**Location:** Torremolinos, Spain  
**Subject:** Distillation of "Olivier’s" 1st Decan Aquarius  

*Note: For the purposes of this entry, "ultra-filtered blood plasma" will be referred to simply as "plasma" for ease of reading.*

## 1. Equipment & Process Methodology
**Apparatus:** Vevor Distillation Unit (3000 ml capacity, vevor.com)
**Starting Volume:** Approximately 2.5 liters of aged plasma.

The distillation of the aged plasma resulted in a multi-stage separation, fractionating the liquid into volatile distillates (the "Solar" fractions) and a non-volatile concentrate (the "Lunar" fraction). 

*Operational Note:* During this run, the 3000 ml chamber was filled to capacity. The boiling process of the dense plasma created a heavy foam, leading to an overflow that naturally separated the volatile distillate into two distinct stages. For future iterations, the distillation chamber will only be filled to half capacity. The beginning stage must be closely monitored to scoop off the rising foam as needed; a wooden spoon was utilized effectively for this purpose.

## 2. The Volatile Distillate Fractions (Solar Portions)

* **Fraction 1: The Active Distillate (Foaming Overflow)**
  * **Yield:** Approximately 500 ml
  * **PPM Reading:** 450 – 466 (Highly volatile, fluctuating before settling around 466).
  * **Characteristics:** Captured early in the process from the initial foaming phase. 
  * **Applications:** Acts as a potent living solvent. Highly effective as a base for medicine making (such as botanical extractions and home tinctures) and serves as a powerful agent for wound cleaning.

* **Fraction 2: The Refined Aqueous Distillate**
  * **Yield:** Approximately 1.25 liters
  * **PPM Reading:** 18
  * **Characteristics:** Collected in the glass carafe as the distillation continued smoothly. Visually super clear.
  * **Sensory Notes:** The taste carries a distinct solvent undertone—less harsh than Fraction 1, but still undeniably present. 
  * **Applications:** Currently being utilized effectively as a facial toner, sharing the exceptional cleaning properties of the primary fraction.

* **Control Sample**
  * **Tap Water PPM:** 336 (Measured for baseline comparison).

## 3. The Non-Volatile Concentrate / Retentate (Lunar Portion)
The distillation was halted when approximately 1/4 of the volume remained in the chamber, leaving a dark, oily concentrated retentate resembling dark coffee.

* **Yield:** Approximately 500 ml
* **Filtration:** On the evening of February 18, this concentrate was processed using three coffee filters. 
* **Sensory Notes:** Soft to the touch, feeling akin to a body lotion or butter. It "smells alive" and possesses a texture so soft that it feels intimately close to the self. The taste is profoundly umami, characterized by naturally organic, living earth salts.
* **Dietary Context:** The rich presence of these organic salts is highly notable, as it manifests despite a strictly no sodium chloride diet for over a month, and a broader practice of avoiding sodium chloride almost entirely over the past year (with only rare, intentional consumption). 
* **PPM Reading:** Tested on February 19. The rich density of this concentrate over-read the meter, exceeding its maximum display limit of 9999 PPM.
* **Applications:** Best suited for topical application on the skin and specifically indicated for wound healing (complementing the wound-cleaning properties of the solar distillates). Additionally, due to its dense mineral profile, it has been successfully utilized in meals to provide a living, umami flavor. 

## 4. Conclusion & Alchemical Insights
Observing the fractionated plasma function simultaneously as a medicinal solvent and a nutrient-dense concentrate provides a profound physical demonstration of the body's internal mechanisms. The solvent-like taste and high volatility of the early distillates reveal the immense, self-cleaning power inherent in the human system. 

The plasma naturally separates into purifying solvents (Solar/Cleaning) and dense, grounding elements (Lunar/Healing). Extracting such rich, umami earth salts from the non-volatile retentate—entirely independent of dietary sodium chloride intake—perfectly illustrates the body's own continuous internal distillation, mineral generation, and purification process.

## 5. Archival Notes & Next Steps
* **Labeling:** The batch is cataloged as *"Olivier’s Plasma. 1st decan Aquarius"*.
* **Visual Archive:** Photographic records (including the active distillate stage) are archived here: [Google Photos Gallery](https://photos.app.goo.gl/WhErNQPusHMMV8WU9). Images document the dark retentate against the light to capture exact color density and texture, as well as the initial volatile output.
* **Future Exploration:** Begin testing the 460 PPM Active Distillate (Fraction 1) as a primary solvent base for upcoming home tinctures, observing how its "living" quality interacts with other botanical elements.
