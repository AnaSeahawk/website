**Experiment Report & Journal Entry: Aged Ultra Filtered Blood Plasma Distillation**

Date: February 18–19, 2026
Location: Torremolinos, Spain
Subject: Distillation of "Olivier’s" 1st Decan Aquarius
Note: For the purposes of this entry, "ultra filtered blood plasma" will be referred to simply as "plasma" for ease of reading.
1. The Distillation Process & Stages
The distillation of the aged plasma resulted in a multi-stage separation, revealing distinct alchemical properties. Because the distillation chamber was full, the boiling process created a heavy foam, leading to an overflow that naturally separated the "Solar" (volatile) waters into two distinct stages before reaching the final "Lunar" residue.
2. Digital Meter Readings (PPM) & Observations
 * Stage 1: The Foaming Overflow (Active Solar Portion)
   * PPM Reading: 450 – 466 (Highly volatile, fluctuating before settling around 466).
   * Characteristics: This portion was captured early in the process once the initial heavy foaming began to lighten. It acts as both a living tincture and a potent solvent.
   * Applications: Highly suitable as a living solvent for extracting home tinctures.
 * Stage 2: The Clear Distillate (Refined Solar Portion)
   * PPM Reading: 18
   * Characteristics: Collected in the glass carafe as the distillation continued smoothly. It is super clear.
   * Sensory Notes: The taste carries a distinct solvent undertone—less harsh than the Stage 1 overflow, but still undeniably present.
   * Applications: Currently being utilized effectively as a facial toner.
 * Control Sample
   * Tap Water PPM: 336 (Measured for baseline comparison).
3. The Lunar Portion (Chamber Residue)
The distillation was halted when approximately 1/4 of the volume remained in the chamber, leaving a dark, oily residue resembling dark coffee.
 * Filtration: On the evening of February 18, this portion (approximately 500ml) was processed using three coffee filters.
 * Sensory Notes: Soft to the touch, feeling akin to a body lotion or butter. It "smells alive" and possesses a texture so soft that it feels intimately close to the self. The taste is profoundly umami, characterized by naturally organic, living earth salts.
 * Dietary Context: The rich presence of these organic salts is highly notable, as it manifests despite a strictly no sodium chloride diet for over a month, and a broader practice of avoiding sodium chloride almost entirely over the past year (with only rare, intentional consumption).
 * PPM Reading: Tested on February 19. As initially suspected, the rich density of this liquid over-read the meter, exceeding its maximum display limit of 9999 PPM.
4. Conclusion & Alchemical Insights
Observing the distilled plasma function simultaneously as a tincture and a living solvent provides a profound physical demonstration of the body's internal mechanisms. The solvent-like taste and high volatility of the early distillate reveal the immense, self-cleaning power inherent in the human system.
The ultra-filtered blood plasma naturally separates into purifying solvents and dense, grounding elements. Extracting such rich, umami earth salts from the lunar residue—entirely independent of dietary sodium chloride intake—perfectly illustrates the body's own continuous internal distillation, mineral generation, and purification process.
5. Archival Notes & Next Steps
 * Labeling: The batch is cataloged as "Olivier’s Plasma. 1st decan Aquarius".
 * Documentation: Photographic records of the dark "Lunar" liquid were taken against the light to capture the exact color density and texture for the archives.
 * Future Exploration: Begin testing the 460 PPM Stage 1 liquid as a primary solvent base for upcoming home tinctures, observing how its "living" quality interacts with other botanical or alchemical elements.
