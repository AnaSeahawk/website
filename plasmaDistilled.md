# Experiment Report & Journal Entry: Aged Ultra-Filtered Blood Plasma Distillation

**By:** Ana Seahawk 
**Date:** February 18–19, 2026  
**Location:** Torremolinos, Spain  
**Subject:** Distillation of "Olivier’s" 1st Decan Aquarius, 5919 Anno Mundi ("In the Year of the World") — January 20 to January 29, 2026

*Note: For the purposes of this entry, "ultra-filtered blood plasma" will be referred to simply as "plasma" for ease of reading.*

### The Biological Baseline: A Four-Year Isopathic Closed Loop

To accurately interpret the extreme electrochemical metrics of this distillation (pH 10.28, 12.75 MS/CM), it is necessary to establish the exact nature of the biological input. The fluid utilized in this initial distillation did not originate from a standard, unconditioned physiological baseline. 

The primary input was harvested from a host (Olivier / Ligoldragon) actively engaged in the continuous, closed-loop practice of Amaroli (Shivambu) for nearly four solar years. 

This lifestyle fundamentally alters the biological terrain. The practice extends far beyond the topical application of Plasma Lotion (which has been utilized for three years for severe dermal healing and microbiome restoration). The host's terrain is actively saturated with its own biological resonance through:
* The daily, continuous oral ingestion of fresh ultra-filtered blood plasma.
* Deep-tissue microbiome integration via regular aged plasma enemas.
* Full-body dermal absorption through baths.
* Environmental and energetic integration (utilizing the fluid as a laundry and cleansing agent).



This distinction is mathematically and structurally profound. In the study of organic fluid biocrystallization, researchers observing the life forces within bodily fluids (such as the work of Fiona Gardner) note a stark contrast between conditioned and unconditioned biology. The ultra-filtered plasma of a non-practicing individual may exhibit a faint energetic "spark" under crystallization, but it fails to grow a coherent, complex geometric pattern. It lacks the compounded memory of a sovereign feedback loop.

Conversely, a body steeped in four years of continuous biological feedback produces a fluid that is highly organized, structurally dense, and energetically potent. Therefore, the explosive voltage and hyper-conductivity captured in the Plasma Spirit of this distillation are not merely the byproduct of anaerobic aging. They are the mathematical expression of a structurally optimized terrain. The fluid is already acting as **The Great Medicine** long before it enters the distillation chamber, carrying a compounded density of vital force (*Prana*) that an unconditioned baseline simply cannot replicate.


## 1. Equipment & Process Methodology
**Apparatus:** * Vevor Distillation Unit (3000 ml capacity, vevor.com)
* PIOUS 5-in-1 Water Quality Meter (measuring pH, PPM, Salt %, MS/CM / US/CM, and PPT)

**Starting Volume:** Approximately 2.5 liters of syphoned aged plasma. Syphoned to eliminate the naturally forming sediment that accumulates during fermentation.

The distillation of the aged plasma resulted in a multi-stage separation, fractionating the liquid into volatile distillates (the "Solar" fractions) and a non-volatile concentrate (the "Lunar" fraction). 

*Operational Note:* During this run, the 3000 ml chamber was filled to capacity. The boiling process of the dense plasma created a heavy foam, leading to an overflow that naturally separated the volatile distillate into two distinct stages. For future iterations, the distillation chamber will only be filled to half capacity. The beginning stage must be closely monitored to scoop off the rising foam as needed; a wooden spoon was utilized effectively for this purpose.

## 2. The Volatile Distillate Fractions (Solar Portions)

* **Fraction 1: Plasma Spirit - The Active Distillate (Foaming Overflow)**
  * **Yield:** Approximately 500 ml
  * **Readings (at 23.1°C):** pH 10.26 – 10.28 | Salt 0.66% – 0.68% | Salt PPM: 6,720 | Conductivity: 12.75 MS/CM
  * **Characteristics:** Captured early in the process from the initial foaming phase. Highly alkaline with a notable salt load.
  * **Applications:** Acts as a potent living solvent. Highly effective as a base for medicine making (such as botanical extractions and home tinctures) and serves as a powerful agent for wound cleaning.

* **Fraction 2: Plasma Water - The Refined Aqueous Distillate**
  * **Yield:** Approximately 1.25 liters
  * **Readings:** pH 10.14 – 10.15 | Salt 0.04% | PPM: 453 | Conductivity: 904 US/CM
  * **Characteristics:** Collected in the glass carafe as the distillation continued smoothly. Visually super clear, highly alkaline, but significantly more refined with a much lower salt content than Fraction 1.
  * **Sensory Notes:** The taste carries a distinct solvent undertone—less harsh than Fraction 1, but still undeniably present. 
  * **Applications:** Currently being utilized effectively as a facial toner, sharing the exceptional cleaning properties of the primary fraction.

## 3. The Non-Volatile Concentrate / Retentate (Lunar Portion)
The distillation was halted when approximately 1/4 of the volume remained in the chamber, leaving a dark, oily concentrated retentate resembling dark coffee.

* **Yield:** Approximately 500 ml
* **Filtration:** On the evening of February 18, this concentrate was processed using three coffee filters. 
* **Readings (at 23.8°C):** pH 7.17 | Salt 2.75% – 2.81% | PPT: 23.4 | Conductivity: 46.6 – 46.8 MS/CM
* **Sensory Notes:** Soft to the touch, feeling akin to a body lotion or butter, the skin soaks it up. It "smells alive" and possesses a texture so soft that it feels intimately close to the self. The taste is profoundly umami, characterized by naturally organic, living earth salts.

* **Applications:** Best suited for topical application on the skin and specifically indicated for wound healing (complementing the wound-cleaning properties of the solar distillates). Additionally, due to its dense mineral profile and near-neutral pH, it has been successfully utilized in meals to provide a living, umami flavor. 

* **Dietary Context:** The rich presence of these organic salts (measuring nearly 3% salt concentration) is highly notable, as it manifests despite a strictly no sodium chloride diet for over a month, and a broader practice of avoiding sodium chloride almost entirely over the past year (with only rare, intentional consumption). 4 Years Vegan diet, recently in the duration of this collection and ferment, the diet has been like that of a Sherpa, everything with ghee, some olive oil. Grains & beans: Rice, wheat berries, oats and mung bean. Dairy: butter, yougart, whole milk and some cream. Spices: cumin and fennel. Herbals: triphala, aswagand, brahmin. Stimulants: Coffee. Some honey.

## 4. Conclusion & Alchemical Insights
Observing the fractionated plasma function simultaneously as a medicinal solvent and a nutrient-dense concentrate provides a profound physical demonstration of the body's internal mechanisms. The solvent-like taste and high alkalinity of the early distillates reveal the immense, self-cleaning power inherent in the human system. 

The plasma naturally separates into purifying alkaline solvents (Solar/Cleaning) and dense, pH-neutral, grounding elements (Lunar/Healing). Extracting such rich, umami earth salts from the non-volatile retentate—entirely independent of dietary sodium chloride intake—perfectly illustrates the body's own continuous internal distillation, mineral generation, and purification process.

## 5. Archival Notes & Next Steps
* **Labeling:** The batch is cataloged as *"Olivier’s Plasma. 1st decan Aquarius"*.
* **Visual Archive:** Photographic records (including the active distillate stage) are archived here: [Google Photos Gallery](https://photos.app.goo.gl/WhErNQPusHMMV8WU9). Images document the dark retentate against the light to capture exact color density and texture, as well as the initial volatile output.

* **Future Exploration:** Begin testing the Active Distillate (Fraction 1) as a primary solvent base for upcoming home tinctures, observing how its "living" quality interacts with other botanical elements.
