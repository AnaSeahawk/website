# Experiment Report & Journal Entry: Aged Ultra-Filtered Blood Plasma Distillation

**By:** Ana Seahawk 
**Date:** February 18–19, 2026  
**Location:** Torremolinos, Spain  
**Subject:** Distillation of "Olivier’s" 1st Decan Aquarius, 5919 Anno Mundi ("In the Year of the World") — January 20 to January 29, 2026

*Note: For the purposes of this entry, "ultra-filtered blood plasma" will be referred to simply as "plasma" for ease of reading.*

## 1. Equipment & Process Methodology
**Apparatus:** * Vevor Distillation Unit (3000 ml capacity, vevor.com)
* PIOUS 5-in-1 Water Quality Meter (measuring pH, PPM, Salt %, MS/CM / US/CM, and PPT)

**Starting Volume:** Approximately 2.5 liters of aged plasma.

The distillation of the aged plasma resulted in a multi-stage separation, fractionating the liquid into volatile distillates (the "Solar" fractions) and a non-volatile concentrate (the "Lunar" fraction). 

*Operational Note:* During this run, the 3000 ml chamber was filled to capacity. The boiling process of the dense plasma created a heavy foam, leading to an overflow that naturally separated the volatile distillate into two distinct stages. For future iterations, the distillation chamber will only be filled to half capacity. The beginning stage must be closely monitored to scoop off the rising foam as needed; a wooden spoon was utilized effectively for this purpose.

## 2. The Volatile Distillate Fractions (Solar Portions)

* **Fraction 1: The Active Distillate (Foaming Overflow)**
  * **Yield:** Approximately 500 ml
  * **Readings (at 23.1°C):** pH 10.26 – 10.28 | Salt 0.66% – 0.68% | Salt PPM: 6,720 | Conductivity: 12.75 MS/CM
  * **Characteristics:** Captured early in the process from the initial foaming phase. Highly alkaline with a notable salt load.
  * **Applications:** Acts as a potent living solvent. Highly effective as a base for medicine making (such as botanical extractions and home tinctures) and serves as a powerful agent for wound cleaning.

* **Fraction 2: The Refined Aqueous Distillate**
  * **Yield:** Approximately 1.25 liters
  * **Readings:** pH 10.14 – 10.15 | Salt 0.04% | PPM: 453 | Conductivity: 904 US/CM
  * **Characteristics:** Collected in the glass carafe as the distillation continued smoothly. Visually super clear, highly alkaline, but significantly more refined with a much lower salt content than Fraction 1.
  * **Sensory Notes:** The taste carries a distinct solvent undertone—less harsh than Fraction 1, but still undeniably present. 
  * **Applications:** Currently being utilized effectively as a facial toner, sharing the exceptional cleaning properties of the primary fraction.

## 3. The Non-Volatile Concentrate / Retentate (Lunar Portion)
The distillation was halted when approximately 1/4 of the volume remained in the chamber, leaving a dark, oily concentrated retentate resembling dark coffee.

* **Yield:** Approximately 500 ml
* **Filtration:** On the evening of February 18, this concentrate was processed using three coffee filters. 
* **Readings (at 23.8°C):** pH 7.17 | Salt 2.75% – 2.81% | PPT: 23.4 | Conductivity: 46.6 – 46.8 MS/CM
* **Sensory Notes:** Soft to the touch, feeling akin to a body lotion or butter. It "smells alive" and possesses a texture so soft that it feels intimately close to the self. The taste is profoundly umami, characterized by naturally organic, living earth salts.
* **Dietary Context:** The rich presence of these organic salts (measuring nearly 3% salt concentration) is highly notable, as it manifests despite a strictly no sodium chloride diet for over a month, and a broader practice of avoiding sodium chloride almost entirely over the past year (with only rare, intentional consumption). 
* **Applications:** Best suited for topical application on the skin and specifically indicated for wound healing (complementing the wound-cleaning properties of the solar distillates). Additionally, due to its dense mineral profile and near-neutral pH, it has been successfully utilized in meals to provide a living, umami flavor. 

## 4. Conclusion & Alchemical Insights
Observing the fractionated plasma function simultaneously as a medicinal solvent and a nutrient-dense concentrate provides a profound physical demonstration of the body's internal mechanisms. The solvent-like taste and high alkalinity of the early distillates reveal the immense, self-cleaning power inherent in the human system. 

The plasma naturally separates into purifying alkaline solvents (Solar/Cleaning) and dense, pH-neutral, grounding elements (Lunar/Healing). Extracting such rich, umami earth salts from the non-volatile retentate—entirely independent of dietary sodium chloride intake—perfectly illustrates the body's own continuous internal distillation, mineral generation, and purification process.

## 5. Archival Notes & Next Steps
* **Labeling:** The batch is cataloged as *"Olivier’s Plasma. 1st decan Aquarius"*.
* **Visual Archive:** Photographic records (including the active distillate stage) are archived here: [Google Photos Gallery](https://photos.app.goo.gl/WhErNQPusHMMV8WU9). Images document the dark retentate against the light to capture exact color density and texture, as well as the initial volatile output.

* **Future Exploration:** Begin testing the Active Distillate (Fraction 1) as a primary solvent base for upcoming home tinctures, observing how its "living" quality interacts with other botanical elements.
