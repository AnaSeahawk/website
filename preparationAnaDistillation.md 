# The Amaroli Ritual of the Golden Syphon

**Date of Execution:** Sunday, February 22, 2026 (Sun Day / Taurus Moon)  
**Batch Origin:** February 1, 2026 (Sun in Aquarius / Moon in Leo)  

### I. The Internal Alignment (The Resonance)
The ritual begins not in the flask, but in the body. By receiving the enema from the sister-bottle of this exact Leo Full Moon batch, the internal vessel is tuned to the exact frequency of the external vessel. The microcosm and macrocosm are locked into resonance. The body remembers the *Samskara* (imprint) of February 1st, ensuring the practitioner is an undistorted conduit for the work ahead.

### II. The Gathering of *Tejas* (The Solar Incubation)
The chosen fluid is brought into the light. For two days, it is placed in the direct rays of the Sun to awaken the *Tejas* (the subtle fire) within the water. Through the night, it is kept warm, protecting its vitality, before returning to the morning sun. The fluid is activated, alive, and vibrating with solar charge.

### III. The Separation of Worlds (The Yin-Yang Syphon)
The vessel is elevated to a high shelf, untouched, allowing gravity to perform the first alchemical separation. The heavy sediment (Yin) settles to the deep, while the clear, subtle essence (Yang) rises to the top. Under the seal of the Yin-Yang symbol, only the pure, uppermost fluid is gently syphoned off. This is the extraction of the *Jing*—leaving the dense matter behind to harvest only the clear mirror of the plasma.

### IV. The Ancestral Battery (The Golden Anchor)
The clarified fluid is placed back in the sun, seated upon an altar of ancestral alchemy. Beneath the vessel rests:
* **The Master’s Gold:** A handmade Yellowknife gold bracelet, gifted at 19, carrying the inscribed lineage of a father who mastered both the chemistry of the pharmacist and the noble metals of the goldsmith.
* **The Solar Stone:** A citrine teardrop held in a gold basket on a silver chain, anchoring the light.
* **The Sovereign Wealth:** A 20-Franc gold rooster coin.

These items act as a physical battery. They charge the fluid with the frequency of enduring abundance, mastery, and the transmutation of base elements into gold.

### V. The Intention and the Heat (The Distillation)
Having been blessed in the stillness of the night, aligned with the body in the morning, clarified through the syphon, and charged upon the ancestral gold, the fluid is ready. It holds the maximum potential. The heat is applied, and the distillation begins—transforming the golden water into the vapor of pure spirit, ready to be measured and recorded.
